The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information ceased providing support for this product in May 2025 in response to an initiative to implement reductions within the U.S. federal government. 
This dataset contains U.S. disaster cost assessments of the total, direct losses ($) inflicted by: tropical cyclones, inland floods, drought & heat waves, severe local storms (i.e., tornado, hail, straight-line wind damage), wildfires, crop freeze events and winter storms. 
These assessments require input from a variety of public and private data sources including: 
- the Insurance Services Office (ISO) Property Claim Services (PCS), 
- Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and Presidential Disaster Declaration (PDD) assistance, and the 
- United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) & Risk Management Agency (RMA), 
- the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) and 
- state agency reporting, among others. 
Each of these data sources provides unique information as part of the overall disaster loss assessment.
